### What I learned from this course:

- Learned how to read and write data of on-chain data from client side.
- Learned how to implement with Rust native for add and update functions.

### What I modified on this course:

- You could see all program code in program file that already included in my repo.
- Modified for adding location as string both of program and front-end side as homework's description.
- Modified for adding update's function and you can test to update when you clicked to Review card and can able to update in Form structure automatically.
- Modified to show loading time when users trying to interact with on-chain.
- Modified to read data which coming from on-chain that users could see "location" also.
